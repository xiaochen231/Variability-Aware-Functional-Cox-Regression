To reproduce the simulation results, the following steps can be followed. 
First, run the script main.R to obtain the raw results, which are saved in Excel format. 
Second, execute getRdata.R to generate the corresponding RData file based on the raw outputs. 
Finally, run the R scripts located in the ‘Figures’ folder to produce all figures presented in the paper.
